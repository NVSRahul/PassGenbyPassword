# PassGenbyPassword

This the project that is done by me 
In this project you can generate your own password by giving your simple passoword 
In this you can change the dictionary assigned value as your wish with your own secret code for each letter and number
This is easy to use and kind of fun 
In this project you can find out 10 different variants of passwords genearator 
You can use any of there for your convenient 
But I recommend you to use the advanced_genpass of any kind means randomly generated or orderly generated password
